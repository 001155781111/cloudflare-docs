    title: Beta available for SQLite storage in every Durable Object 
    description: |-
      New beta version of Durable Objects is available where each Durable Object has a private, embedded SQLite database. When deploying a new Durable Object class, users can [opt-in to using SQL storage](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sql-storage) in order to access [Storage SQL API methods](/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#sqlexec).

      You cannot enable SQL storage and SQL API methods on an existing, deployed Durable Object class. Automatic migration of deployed classes to allow SQL access will be available in the future.

      During the initial beta, Storage API billing is not enabled for Durable Object classes with SQL storage. SQLite-backed Durable Objects will incur [charges for requests and duration](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#billing-metrics). We plan to enable [SQL storage billing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#sql-storage-billing) in the first half of 2025 with advance notice. SQL billing metrics will be added to GraphQL analytics in the future as well.

      [Exceptions](/durable-objects/best-practices/error-handling) thrown from Durable Object internal operations and tunneled to the caller may now be populated with a `.retryable: true` property if the exception was likely due to a transient failure, or populated with an `.overloaded: true` property if the exception was due to [overload](/durable-objects/observability/troubleshooting/#durable-object-is-overloaded).

    title: Durable Objects support for Oceania region
    description: |-
      Durable Objects can reside in Oceania, lowering Durable Objects request latency for eyeball Workers in Oceania locations.

      Refer to [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/reference/data-location/#provide-a-location-hint) to provide location hints to objects.

    title: Billing reduction for WebSocket messages
    description: |-
      Durable Objects [request billing](/durable-objects/platform/pricing/#billing-metrics) applies a 20:1 ratio for incoming WebSocket messages. For example, 1 million Websocket received messages across connections would be charged as 50,000 Durable Objects requests.

      This is a billing-only calculation and does not impact Durable Objects [metrics and analytics](/durable-objects/observability/graphql-analytics/).
