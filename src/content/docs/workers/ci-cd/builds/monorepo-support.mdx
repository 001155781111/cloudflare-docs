You can choose to use a monorepo (a Git repository that contains multiple project) with Workers Builds. Here is how you can set it up:

## Set up

To set up a monorepo with Workers Builds:

1. Connect your monorepo git repository to each of your associated Workers on the dashboard
2. Set up your build to only deploy to each specific Worker by setting the correct root directory in your build configuration

When a new commit is detected in the monorepo, all the associated Workers will trigger a new build and deploy.

## Example

In the example `ecommerce-monorepo`, a Workers project should be created for `product-service`, `auth-service`, `order-service`, and `notification-service`.

A git connection to `ecommerce-monorepo` should be added in all of the Workers projects, with the root directory in the Workers' build configurations set as `workers/product-service/`, `workers/auth-service/`, `workers/order-service/`, and `workers/notification-service/` corresponding to the Worker. Note that a `wrangler.toml` should exist in the root directory of the Worker.

When a git push is made to `ecommerce-monorepo`, a build will be triggered for all of the Workers.
