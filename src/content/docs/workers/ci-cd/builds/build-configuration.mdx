You may tell Workers Builds how your application needs to be built and deployed.

## Build Settings

Build settings can be found on the **Settings > Builds** section of your Worker. The following options are available:

| **Field**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Git account**               | Set the Git account you would like to choose your repository from.                                                                                                                  |
| **Git repository**            | Select the Git repository you would like to connect to your Worker.                                                                                                                 |
| **Git branch**                | Select the branch you would like Cloudflare to listen to for new commits. This will be defaulted to `main`.                                                                         |
| **Build command** (Optional)  | Add a build command if your project requires a build step. This is necessary, for example, when building with assets.                                                               |
| **Deploy command**            | The deploy command lets you choose the specific Wrangler command you would like to use to deploy your Worker.                                                                       |
| **Root Directory** (Optional) | Specify the root directory of your Worker. The root directory describes where the build command will run.                                                                           |
| **API Key**                   | By default, Cloudflare will generate an API token for your account. Alternatively, you can create and select an existing API token from a previous build in the API token dropdown. |
| **Build variable** (Optional) | Add variables and secrets accessible only to your build.                                                                                                                            |

### Deploy Command

After your Workers project is built, the Wrangler command you specify will be ran to deploy your project to Cloudflare's Global Network.

Your deploy command is defaulted to `npx wrangler deploy`. However, you can [customize the command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) based on your deployment needs. Alternatively, you can also upload the build as a version and use [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/).

### Default API Token

Note the default API Token created will contain the following permissions:

- **Account:** Account Settings (read), Workers Scripts (edit), Workers KV Storage (edit), Workers R2 Storage (edit)
- **Zone:** Workers Routes (edit) for all zones on the account
- **User:** User Details (read), Memberships (read)
