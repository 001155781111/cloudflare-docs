You may tell Workers Builds how your application needs to be built and deployed.

## Build Settings

Build settings can be found on the **Settings** page of your Worker. The following options are available:

- **Git account**
  - Set the git account you would like to choose your repository from.
- **Git repository**
  - Select the git repository you would like to connect to your Worker.
- **Git branch**
  - Select the branch you would like Cloudflare to listen to for new commits. This will be defaulted to main.
- **Build command** _(Optional)_
  - Add a build command if your project requires a build step. This is necessary, for example, when building with assets.
- **Deploy command**
  - The deploy command lets you choose the specific Wrangler command you would like to use to deploy your Worker. Your deploy command is defaulted to `npx wrangler deploy`, but it can be customized as needed. You can also upload as a version and take advantage of [gradual deployments](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/).
- **Root Directory** _(Optional)_
  - Specify the root directory of your Worker. The root directory describes where the build command will run.
- **API Key** _(Optional)_
  - By default, Cloudflare will generate an API token for your account. Alternatively, you can create and select an existing API token from a previous build in the API token drop down. These API tokens will be created with the following permissions for your account:
    - **Account:** Account Settings (read), Workers Scripts (edit), Workers KV Storage (edit), Workers R2 Storage (edit)
    - **Zone:** Workers Routes (edit) for all zones on the account
    - **User:** User Details (read), Memberships (read)
- **Build variable** _(Optional)_
  - Add variables and secrets accessible only to your build.
