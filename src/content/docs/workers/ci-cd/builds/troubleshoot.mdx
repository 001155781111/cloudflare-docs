## Troubleshooting View

You can use the build logs view to troubleshoot a failed build. The build logs can provide you with insight into what happened during the build and deploy process.

1. Select your Worker on the **Workers & Pages dashboard**
2. Go to the **Deployments** tab, and select **"View build history"** to see a full list of your builds
3. Select **"View build"** for the build you would like to troubleshoot

In the Build details view, you should see details for that build such as its build settings, build duration, and its associated git repository and branch.

## Debugging

- **Updating API Tokens:** If you have updated an API Token, the changes may not be reflected in the Build Configuration settings on the dashboard. If you are encountering authentication errors after updating your build's API Token, we recommend creating a new API Token for the build.
- **Failed Builds stuck in In-Progress:** If your build has failed but the status still show that the build is "In-progress", you should cancel the build, review your build configuration, then retry the build.
