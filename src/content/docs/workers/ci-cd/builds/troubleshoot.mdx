## Troubleshooting & Debugging

- **Updating API Tokens:** If you have updated an API Token, the changes may not be reflected in the Build Configuration settings on the dashboard. If you are encountering authentication errors after updating your build's API Token, we recommend creating a new API Token for the build.
- **Failed Builds stuck in In-Progress:** If your build has failed but the status still show that the build is "In-progress", you should cancel the build, review your build configuration, then retry the build.
