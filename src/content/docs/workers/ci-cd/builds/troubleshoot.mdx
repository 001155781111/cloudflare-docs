## Known Issues

- **Updating API Tokens:** If you have updated an API Token, the changes may not be reflected in the Build Configuration settings on the dashboard. If you are encountering authentication errors after updating your build's API Token, we recommend creating a new API Token for the build.
- **Failed Builds stuck in In-Progress:** If you see in the build logs that your build has failed but the status is hung in "In-progress", we recommend you to cancel the build, review the build configurations, then retry the build.

If you discover additional issues, please notify us in the [Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com).
