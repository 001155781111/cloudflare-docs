description: Preview URLs allow you to preview new versions of your project without deploying it to production.

import { Render } from "~/components";

Preview URLs allow you to preview new versions of your Worker without deploying it to production. A unique preview URL is created for each [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker. By default, preview URLs are enabled and available publicly.

Preview URLs can be:

- Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing automatic generation of preview environments for every pull request.
- Used for collaboration between teams to test code changes in a live environment and verify updates.
- Used to test new API endpoints, validate data formats, and ensure backward compatibility with existing services.

When testing zone level performance or security featues for a version, it's recommended to use [version overrides](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/#version-overrides) so that your zone's performance and security settings apply.

:::note
Preview URLs are only available for Worker versions uploaded past 2024-09-25.

## View preview URLs using wrangler

The [`wrangler versions upload`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#upload) command uploads a new [version](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your Worker and returns a preview URL for each version uploaded.

## View preview URLs on the Workers dashboard

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) and select your project.
2. Head to the "Deployments" tab find the version you would like to view.

## Disabling Preview URLs

Preview URLs run on your [`workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/). If your `workers.dev` subdomain is enabled for a Worker, it will automatically generate preview URLs for the Worker.

To disable preview URLs, you must disable your Workers `workers.dev` subdomain. Learn how to [disable your Workers `workers.dev` subdomain](/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/#disabling-workersdev).

## Limitations

- Preview URLs are not generated for Workers with a Durable Objects binding.
- You cannot currently secure `workers.dev` URLs behind [Cloudflare Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/). This is a temporary limitation, we are working to remove it.
