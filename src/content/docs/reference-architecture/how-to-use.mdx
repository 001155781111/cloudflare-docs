<Description>
	The reference architecture content in this section of our documentation is
	designed to help you understand how Cloudflare has been designed and built,
	and how our products and services integrate with your current IT architecture.

</Description>

Documents are organized into the following types.

## Reference architectures

Reference architecture documents are designed to provide a foundational knowledge of the Cloudflare platform and products while offering a description for how they relate to your existing infrastructure and business challenges. They are high-level, conceptual documents that walk through the concepts of an area of our platform, mapping our network, products and features to the typical architecture of a customer's environment. Detailed diagrams with supporting content get across how our technology works and how it can be integrated with your own infrastructure. The goal of a reference architecture is:

- Present thought leadership
- Visualize the architecture
- Explain integration points between Cloudflare and your infrastructure

## Reference architecture diagrams

A reference architecture diagram focusses on a specific solution or use case where Cloudflare can be used. One or more diagrams are the primary content with supporting introduction and summary. These can focus on sections from a reference architecture that are not fully developed. The goal of this type of document is:

- Visualize the components of a specific solution's architecture
- Provide a quick answer to a specific question around a use case

## Design guides

These guides are typically aimed at architects, developers, and IT professionals who are tasked with designing and deploying systems that leverage the company's technologies. They typically focus on a specific solution that would be a subset of the greater architecture. i.e. you have read our SASE Reference Architecture, but are a startup and want to understand the details of using a SASE approach for a small startup. These documents are:

- More prescriptive than reference architectures.
- Focused on a solution design that you are trying to achieve. i.e. connecting private networks to Cloudflare, or using a web application firewall to secure a public website.
- Not a replacement for product documentation and do not describe specific product configuration or commands to run.

## Implementation guides

A detailed document that provides step-by-step instructions and practical guidance for users to effectively deploy and configure specific solutions or services. It is typically focused on a specific implementation goal that would be described in their design for a solution. I.e. a design guide provides the overall best practices for designing a solution, the implementation guide narrows down the actual steps to deploy. These documents are:

- Focused on a specific implementation outcome, i.e. Connecting a remote office with Magic WAN Connector.
- Can be industry specific, "Deployment guide for using Cloudflare Gateway to protect financial institutions"
