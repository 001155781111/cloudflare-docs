C3 will ask if you would like to deploy the project to Cloudflare.

- If you choose to deploy, you will be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed to the Cloudflare global network.
- If you choose not to deploy, go to the newly created project directory to begin writing code. You can deploy your project later.
