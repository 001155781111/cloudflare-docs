{{<heading-pill style="beta">}} Cloudflare Advanced DNS Protection {{</heading-pill>}}

Cloudflare Advanced DNS Protection, powered by [`flowtrackd`](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-flowtrackd/), provides stateful protection against DNS-based DDoS attacks, specifically sophisticated and fully randomized DNS attacks such as [random prefix attacks](/dns/dns-firewall/random-prefix-attacks/about/).

## Setup

1. Contact your account team to enable Advanced DNS Protection and make the initial configuration. The initial thresholds are based on your networkâ€™s individual behavior.
2. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account. 
3. Go to **L3/4 DDoS** > **Advanced Protection** > **General settings**.
4. Add the prefixes you wish to onboard. Advanced DNS Protection will only be applied to the prefixes you onboard. If you already onboarded the desired prefixes when you configured Advanced TCP Protection, you do not need to take any other action.

    {{<Aside type="note">}}
Currently, the list of onboarded prefixes is shared with Advanced TCP Protection. Any onboarded prefixes will be subject to both Advanced TCP Protection and Advanced DNS Protection, assuming that your account team has done the initial configuration of both systems. However, you can leave Advanced TCP Protection in monitoring mode.

5. Go to **Advanced DNS Protection**. 
6. Select **Create Advanced DNS Protection rule**. 
7. In **Mode**, select a mode for the rule.
8. Under **Set scope**, select a [scope](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/rule-settings/#scope) to determine the range of packets that will be affected by the rule. 
9. Under **Sensitivity**, define the [burst sensitivity](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/rule-settings/#burst-sensitivity), [rate sensitivity](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/rule-settings/#rate-sensitivity), and [profile sensitivity](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/rule-settings/#profile-sensitivity) to determine when to initiate mitigation. 
10. Select **Deploy**.

## Troubleshooting

### No data about Advanced DNS Protection in Network Analytics

If you cannot find any data related to Advanced DNS Protection in the **DNS Protection** tab of Network Analytics, it could be because one of these reasons:

* You did not [add your prefixes](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/how-to/add-prefix/) to Advanced L3/4 DDoS Protection.
* Cloudflare did not enable the Advanced DNS Protection system yet.
* You do not have any DNS over UDP traffic.

## Data collection

Cloudflare collects DNS-related data such as query type (for example, `A` record) and the queried domains. For details, refer to [Data collection](/analytics/network-analytics/reference/data-collection/).

{{<Aside type="warning">}}
Currently, to disable this data collection you must remove your prefixes either in the Cloudflare dashboard or through the [Delete a prefix](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/api/#prefix-operations) API operation. However, this procedure will remove the prefixes from both Advanced DNS Protection and [Advanced TCP Protection](/ddos-protection/advanced-ddos-systems/overview/advanced-tcp-protection/).

Advanced DNS Protection can protect you against volumetric DNS DDoS attacks. To perform DNS caching, proxying, and configuration, use the [Cloudflare DNS Firewall](/dns/dns-firewall/).

Currently, Advanced DNS Protection is not available for DNS Firewall.
